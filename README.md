Project Plotting - Matplotlib Seaborn, Histograms and Boxplots

The most recent ASC23 considered four major systems-based tracks with a view to providing region-focused contributions to inform the global stocktake among them Cities, urban and rural settlements, infrastructure, and transport.

In this assignment, you will be performing analysis more specifically on transport (vehicles and fuel efficiency). 

The dataset has been provided for you.

You are tasked to make sense of this data that will later be used for AI purposes.

For this assignment, you will use the matplotlib library and seaborn to create diagrams that visualize the relationship between various features (columns) and interpret the diagrams. The steps include:

Accessing the starter notebook hereLinks to an external site. and data hereLinks to an external site.. Download and upload to your own drive. 
Import the necessary libraries. Expect a minimum of 4 libraries

to import the data Correctly and display a few rows,  (4 <rows< 11) 

Create the plots (Plot a histogram and a heatmap) Output should be visible on the notebook

Correctly interpret the diagrams. Interpretation should be on a cell in the notebook as a text or python comment
Export and Submit the PNG files (in a folder) and source code file (notebook).
